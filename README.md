# Yutube_FerandWill
This is our first project (Fernando & William)

The purpose of this was to create a "clone" of youtube with certain specific rules.
However we decided to avoid using the exact same graphic elements as youtube, and do
something really similar, hence the U-Tube "branding" all the icons were designed by us
and so was the U-Tube logo. We took this freedom in order to make the task a little more
fun, and we guessed that this slight deviation wouldn't be a problem.

This project is based on this: https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/html5-and-css3#basic-html-page-structure

After our second review, we were told to make it look exactly as the youtube page, using their logos and so.

Sadly, we were right in our assumption that is was the best to create our own logo and images, since we contacted youtube (mexico) and were denied authorization to use their branding an immage, please refrain from asking us to violate copyright law. This exercise goals are about doing an structurally similar webpage, not about using a thrid party's intelectual property.
