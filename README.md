# Yutube_FerandWill
This is our first project (Fernando & William)

The purpose of this was to create a "clone" of youtube with certain specific rules.
However we decided to avoid using the exact same graphic elements as youtube, and do
something really similar, hence the U-Tube "branding" all the icons were designed by us
and so was the U-Tube logo. We took this freedom in order to make the task a little more
fun, and we guessed that this slight deviation wouldn't be a problem.

This project is based on this: https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/html5-and-css3#basic-html-page-structure
